# Welcome to _printi channels_

A **[printi](https://printi.me) channel** is a document that gets printi'ed every morning, to all the printis that subscribe to that channel. _Anyone can create, edit and subscribe to a channel._ ðŸ‘ª

> Why would I want the same document printi'ed every morning?

Printi channels are _HTML web pages_: âœ¨ they can contain text, images, VIDEOS (haha no it's paper), and with JavaScript, they can **show something new every morning**!

### Examples
Head over to [/good_morning](https://channels.printi.me/good_morning) to have a look at the first channel!

Because _channels_ are HTML documents, they can use scripts! For a basic example, see [/morningcat](https://channels.printi.me/morningcat), and for a more advanced example, look at [/curiosity_diaries](https://channels.printi.me/curiosity_diaries).

### Anyone can write!
To start a new channel, you just pick a [channels.printi.me/cool-channel-name](https://channels.printi.me/cool-channel-name) and start writing! Using the preview, you can see exactly how your script will be printed in the morning.

New to programming? The basics are not that hard! Have a look at the awesome [guides on HMTL, CSS and Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) by Mozilla, and try it out in a playground channel.

Have fun, and let me know what you think!
