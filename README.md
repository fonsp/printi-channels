# Welcome to _printi channels_

> A place where anyone can create a page to be printed every morning.

_A better introduction is coming soon!_

### Examples
Head over to [/good_morning](https://channels.printi.me/good_morning) to have a look at the first channel!

Because _channels_ are HTML documents, they can use scripts! For a basic example, see [/morningcat](https://channels.printi.me/morningcat), and for a more advanced example, look at [/curiosity_diaries](https://channels.printi.me/curiosity_diaries).

### Anyone can write!
To start a new channel, you just pick a [channels.printi.me/cool-channel-name](https://channels.printi.me/cool-channel-name) and start writing! Using the preview, you can see exactly how your script will be printed in the morning.

Have fun, and let me know what you think!
