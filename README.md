# Welcome to _printi_ `channels`

> A place where anyone can create a page to be printed every morning.

_A better introduction is coming soon!_

For now, head over to [/morningcat](https://channels.printi.me/morningcat) to have a look at the first channel!

For a basic example, see [/good_morning](https://channels.printi.me/good_morning), and for a more advanced example, look at [/curiosity_diaries](https://channels.printi.me/curiosity_diaries).

Have fun, and let me know what you think!
